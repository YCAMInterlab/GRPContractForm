#Introduction  

##About the GRPContractForm 


The GRPContractForm is a contract form created with the aim to define creative and open collaboration frameworks. The idea is to establish environments comparable to so-called "open-source codes", and make them available to a broad audience to use, further develop, and/or create derivative works.  

The purpose of this form is to facilitate projects in which art centers invite researchers and engineers in the field of media art to carry out joint research on cutting-edge topics in a residency style, and encourage further development and derivation of the resulting products by making them openly available. One may consider the form as a source code for a framework for such projects.    

This form is published under a Creative Commons license* (for details see "disclaimer" below). Within the scope of the license, users are free to arrange or fork products to fit their respective projects. Requests for updates are also welcome.   


```
* A Creative Commons (CC) license is a form of license for copyrighted work. While there is controversy as to whether 
a contract is a copyrighted work, considering the importance of the fact that the contract and related information are 
to be broadly shared as a new framework for media art, the contract as part of this project is published 
under a CC license.    
```



##Special Features of this Contract Form  

This form was created based on an actual contract used for the implementation of the YCAM InterLab Guest Research Project (GRP), a residency program inviting artists/technicians specializing in cutting-edge topics to carry out joint research and development with the YCAM InterLab staff.  

*YCAM Interlab Guest Research Project* (http://interlab.ycam.jp/projects/guestresearch)

In addition to regulating research contents, residency periods, costs, and other general issues related to joint research and residency projects, this particular contract contains regulations for publishing and improving the efficiency of resulting products. Specified here are, for example, the handling of rights, publishing licenses and methods, as well as credits and maintenance details.    

As this form assumes the invitation of guest researchers from other countries, it contains items related to the necessary international administrative procedures (such as visa and tax issues), insurance, and international transport. The aim is to establish partnerships based on fair relationships between hosts and guest researchers.      

Through the construction of a GRP framework, we learned that a seriously formulated contract helps strengthen the relationships of mutual trust between art centers and artists/technicians, and produce better results. We further think that a contract is very similar to a program code, and are seeing great potential in a mixture of both. In other words, contracts for joint research or commissioned work have a big effect on the eventual creation, whereas the contracts for realizing such frameworks can be developed in cooperation just like program codes. We hope that the publication of this form will help develop frameworks for contemporary forms of creative work.    



##Usage  

Parts in brackets ([]) are to be adapted to each specific contract. Furthermore, as this contract is merely a basic model, other items may require modifications/arrangements to fit the respective project.    
For example, as the form assumes the invitation of guest researchers from abroad, contents will have to be modified for projects on a domestic level. Concrete items to be modified are as follows.    



```
Article 12.1 Commission a) [modify] / 12.3 Transportation Costs [modify] / 12.6 Visa Application [delete]  
Article 13.1 b) [delete] / 13.3 Cooperation for Visa Application [delete] / 13.4 Tax Exemption Procedures [delete]  
```

Research and development activities potentially yield various results. The handling of rights in such products is specified in this article. In principle, intellectual property rights are to be shared (Clause 1), while ownership of material products shall be attributed to the Host (Clause 4). This agreement assumes results mainly in the form of software and hardware, and thus includes clauses especially on respective intellectual property rights (Clauses 2/3). Regarding shared intellectual property rights, both the Host and the Researcher may exercise these rights independently as long as credits are indicated appropriately (Clause 5).  

1 Results of research/development involve the establishment of rights such as copyrights, patent rights, and other intellectual property rights. With the exception of ownership rights in material products (see also Article 9.4), such rights are generally to be shared by the Host and the Researcher.

2 Regarding software produced as a result of the project, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are to be shared by the Host and the Researcher. Rights owned by the Host or the Researcher prior to the start of the project remain in the possession of the respective party. The same applies also to software created as a by-product of the production of hardware as a result of the project. Ownership of material products resulting from software development shall be attributed to the Host as specified in Clause 4. For example, when the process of research and development involves the production of physical experimental equipment, such equipment will be owned by the Host.   

3 Regarding hardware, the sharing of copyrights and other intellectual property rights is to be handled in the same way as software-related rights. "Hardware" in this case refers to "physical materials and devices such as boards or circuits", or as specified in the definition of OSHW, "tangible artificial devices, machines, or other material objects." Not included are photographic prints and text hardcopies. As produced hardware itself is material, it will be owned by the Host as specified in Clause 4.  
The same applies also to hardware created as material by-product of the production of software as a result of the project. 

4 Regarding material products of research/development, all ownership rights will be attributed to the Host. This applies not only to hardware, but also to CDs containing data, printed documents, and any other material objects.  

5 Shared intellectual property rights may be exercised independently by both the Host and the Researcher also after the end of the project. In other words, both are free to replicate or revamp items. This clause enabling both parties to utilize products independently helps avoid trouble caused by disagreement between Host and Researcher regarding shared rights, which would render both sides unable to make use of the produced results. The usage of products requires either side to indicate proper credits. 
   
Problems like the above are circumvented even without this provision regarding the actual publication of products under open licenses. (See also Article 11) After the end of the project, the Researcher is free to use the published codes in keeping with the license agreement. This clause specifies that new problems will not occur.  
Law includes provisions that cannot be altered by way of an agreement. In the case of dissent, provisions of law supersede those specified in an agreement. This clause specifies that the provisions of law prevail in cases where law does not permit the independent exercise of rights.
Data may be used independently.  

*The borderline between creations that involve copyrights, and data that don't, is vague. Meanwhile, also data without internationally recognized copyrights are being published under Creative Commons licenses. At present, this point is not regulated by law, but it is expected to be sorted out in the future.*

6 When the Researcher requires material products resulting from the project, which came into the possession of the Host after the end of the project, the Host shall lend those free of charge (except for actual expenses) whenever possible.   




####Article 10 (Photographs, Video and Audio Recordings) 

> 10.1 As part of the Work, the Researcher agrees to have photographs, video or audio recordings made by the Host or person specified by the Host, to be used for advertisement, research, development, archive creation, and other purposes whenever considered necessary by the Host. 
> 
> 10.2 Copyrights in photographs, video or audio recordings as specified in Article 9.1 shall be attributed to the Host (including rights set forth in the Copyright Act of Japan, Articles 27 & 28). 
> 
> 10.3 The Researcher shall not claim the right of likeness and publicity or other rights in photographs or video recordings as specified in Article 9.1. 
> 
> 10.4 The Researcher shall not exercise moral rights of the author of audio recordings as specified in Article 9.1.
> 
> 10.5 The Researcher may request the supply of photographs, video or audio recordings as specified in Article 9.1 from the Host. However, the Researcher shall be responsible for formalities and other procedures involved in the supply of materials, and cover all expenses.



The Host documents/archives the project's activities in the form of photographs, video or audio recordings, whereas the Researcher agrees to have such records made. While the production and publication of documents are specified in other clauses (8 and 11), copyrights in archives the host creates next to such documents remain in the Host's possession, whereas the Researcher agrees not to claim any portrait rights, copyrights or other personal rights. Accordingly, the Host is free to use the records for publicity and other purposes.
If the Researcher later requires these records, the Researcher may request the Host to provide them free of charge (except for actual costs in cases where expenses occur).    

In this contract, rights related to audio data are attributed to the host. "Audio data" in this case refers not only to voice recordings made during speeches for example, but includes also music. While it may sound unusual that the Host possesses the Researcher's rights in music and other audio data, this provision was included because this agreement places importance on the publication of archives, which can be done smoothly if the Host – who actually publishes the archives – possesses the rights, rather than when rights are shared. Clearly attributing rights, rather than making provisions for the publication of archives, is supposed to help build relationships of mutual trust.  
If, for example, the Researcher is a musician, please consider whether the Host shall possess even the copyrights in the researcher's music, and modify this part if necessary.  




##DivisionⅣ PUBLICATION OF WORKS

####Article 11 (Publication of Works, Open-Source Licensing)

> 11.1 The Researcher agrees the Host or person specified by the Host to publish the Development Results (including downloading and Internet streaming). 
> 
> 11.2 The Researcher agrees the Host to publish the Developed Software under open-source licenses (such as GPL, MIT License, Apache License etc.).
> 
> 11.3 The Researcher agrees the Host to publish all copyrighted items resulting from the Work, except for the Developed Software, under Creative Commons licenses.
> 
> 11.4 Based on the premise that the Researcher has sufficient knowledge of the structures of open source and Creative Commons licenses set forth in Articles 10.2 and 10.3, details such as licensing conditions and methods shall be discussed and determined separately between the Host and the Researcher.


This article contains provisions regarding the publication of products resulting from research/development. (See also Articles 8 and 9) While these basically regulate the publication of software and other copyrighted work (including hardware-related materials, photographs, drawings, etc.), in the case that work contents change with the respective project's outline, subjects and methods of publication will have to be changed accordingly as well. 

1 The positions of the Host is defined as the publishing subject, while the Researcher shall accept the publication. Furthermore, the publication may also be done by persons assigned by the Host. This is to prevent trouble in case the host receives financial aids for example, and the sponsoring institution publishes records as products of their investment.   

2,3 Products are published under open licenses, and are freely available for third parties to use following certain rules. "Open licenses" refers to licenses aimed to make software, hardware and contents openly available, including GPL or MIT licenses, Apache and other licenses for software codes, as well as contents licenses such as Creative Commons. Different licenses contain different rules for the use of products by third parties. Deciding on a license for the publication is an important factor that determines the usage of the respective product. The choice of the type of license should be discussed between the Host and the Researcher, based on considerations of such aspects as future plans and risks to be avoided. (See also Article 11.4)
Copyrighted work other than software is to be published under a Creative Commons license. This license is easy to understand for the user in terms of contents, and is widespread on legal grounds in many countries.
License formats are constantly evolving. The introduction of open-source hardware licenses for example should be considered once such licenses have sufficiently developed.

4 As researchers often use such source code sharing websites as GitHub for their actual work, in some cases it is more efficient if the Researcher does the publication. Details regarding methods of publication corresponding with the circumstances are to be discussed separately. If necessary, the clause may be altered to have results published by the Researcher.




##DivisionⅤ OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

####Article 12 (Host's Obligations)  

> The Host shall assume the following obligations to the Researcher:
> 
> (1) Payment of Commission
>

This article defines obligations on the Host's side. 
  
(1) This clause specifies the amount, time and procedure of payment of commission. Regarding the amount of commission, the clause specifies the actual amount the Researcher receives, which means that the Host shall either add taxes, bank fees etc. to calculate the total expenditure, or in the case of a fixed budget for commissions, deduct taxes and fees from that amount. (If the Researcher is exempt from taxation by tax convention, please refer to Article 13.5) The clause further specifies to what extent the commission covers processing fees, insurance and other expenses. Visa application costs are specified in clause (6). If items other than those specified in this article need to be added to the expenses to be borne by the Host, please make the according additions here. Transportation costs exclude expenses specified in Clause (2).   
  
```  
For domestic researchers, Clause 1a) is to be modified as follows.

a　 The Host shall pay the Researcher **** yen (tax excluded; hereinafter "Commission") as the only compensation for the Assigned Work defined in Article 2. 
The Commission shall cover daily wages, travel expenses (except for the expenses specified in Clause 2a).
Regarding payment of commission based on this clause, the Researcher shall issue estimates and invoices to the Host.
```
  
(2) (3) (4) These clauses contain provisions regarding travel expenses, transportation costs and accommodation. If actual travel expenses exceed the estimated costs by the Researcher’s intention or negligence, the Researcher shall cover the excess portion.
This could be additional fees or cancellation charges that occur when the Researcher misses an airplane and needs to buy another ticket for example. Travel expanses that are not specified in this clause are to be covered by the Researcher as set forth in Clause (1).   
  
```
For domestic researchers, Clause 3 is to be modified as follows.

(3) Transportation costs  
a　Transportation to the Joint Research Facility

```

(5) The Host shall cooperate regarding development activities, and provide necessary devices, components and other equipment to a possible and reasonable extent. 
  
(6) Regarding visa applications, the Host shall cover the costs of application procedures in the country where the Joint Research Facility is located, while the Researcher shall cover expenses that occur in the Researcher's country of residence.
  
```
For domestic researchers, Clause (6) is to be deleted.
```

(7) This clause regulates credits and other indications related to the products resulting from the respective project. The Host shall indicate for all products that these are results of joint research and development with the Joint Research Facility. This must be done continuously into the future. The use of products includes entries in competitions for example. Details of such credits are to be discussed and determined separately.  
The correct indication of credits is helpful in communicating the products' origins and backgrounds to the user, and enables the Host and the Researcher to follow their repercussions. In addition, credits also have a promotional effect.  
  
  
####Article 13 (Researcher's Obligations) 

> The Researcher shall assume the following obligations to Host:
> 
> (1) Payment of expenses

This article defines obligations on the Researcher's side.
  
(1) Specified here are costs occurring on the Researcher's side that are not included in the commission, or in other words, expenses that the Researcher has to cover. If the execution of the Researcher's work involves the use of someone else's music for example, the Researcher shall do the necessary copyrights/licensing procedures, and bear occurring costs. The Host does not pay these costs, and the Researcher is responsible for the proper handling of all rights belonging to third parties. The Researcher shall further buy accident and health insurance for the period from the day of departure from the Researcher's country of residence for the project, up to the day of the Researcher's return, and bear these insurance costs. This part needs to be altered for researchers residing in the country where the Joint Research Facility is located.  
  
  
```
For domestic researchers, Clause 1b) is to be deleted.
```
  
(2) The indication of credits is to be handled as specified in Article 12.7.  
  
(3) The Researcher shall acquire beforehand a visa that is necessary for staying in the respective country for the duration of a project. The acquisition of a visa generally requires a certificate of eligibility. The Researcher shall provide the Host with the necessary documents for acquiring a certificate of eligibility. The period for this procedure is specified here as at least two months before entering the respective country. Once provided with such documents, the Host shall file an application for a certificate of eligibility, however as certificates of eligibility are issued by a state organ, the Host can not guarantee the issuance of such certificate. Once the Host has received a certificate of eligibility, he shall send it to the Researcher.  
After receipt of a certificate of eligibility from the Host, the Researcher shall acquire a necessary visa for staying for the period of the project. The Researcher's passport must be valid until at least six months from the time of entrance into the country, and have at least two blank pages left. This provision is not institutional, and may therefore be altered. Together with the acquisition of a certificate of eligibility, this is one important prior arrangement for being able to stay at the location of the project. This clause may be deleted in case no visa is required. (The same goes for Article 12.6)   
 

```
For domestic researchers, Clause (3) is to be deleted.
```

(4) If a tax convention exists between the country where the Joint Research Facility is located, and the country in which the Researcher pays taxes, and procedures are done properly, taxes (such as income taxes) don't need to be paid. In order to receive an exemption, the Researcher has to prepare the necessary documents (varying by country) and send these to the Host. This shall be done at least one month before entering the respective country. In case there is no tax convention with the country in which the Researcher pays taxes, this clause mey be deleted.    
If there is a tax convention with the country in which the Researcher pays taxes, this clause may be formulated in rather concrete terms according to the respective country.  

*In the case of the USA:*

*"The Researcher shall provide the Host with data or documents required for tax exemption procedures. The Researcher shall apply to the IRS for a "Form 8802" in order to obtain a "Form 6166", and fill out “Form7” (Appilication Form For Income Tax Convention) and “Form17” (Attachment Form For Limitation On Benefits Article). After obtaining a "Form 6166", the Researcher shall send it together with “Form7” and “Form17” to the Host at least one month prior to the Researcher's entrance into Japan."*

```
For domestic researchers, Clause (4) is to be deleted.
```

(5) The Researcher shall provide the Host with materials such as profile, photograph(s), text(s), work documentation (video), printed matter, and others. The Host may use such documents free of charge for PR or report activities. The latter include for example reports from the Host to a sponsor in case the Host receives financial aids.  
The Researcher shall provide the Host with materials such as profile, photograph(s), text(s), work documentation (video), printed matter, and others to be used for PR/report concerning the Work, and allows the Host to use such data free of charge when deemed necessary. 
  
(6) As a matter of course, while staying in the country in which the Joint Research Facility is located, the Researcher obeys that country's laws and the Joint Research Facility's regulations. The Researcher shall assume responsibility for any trouble that occurs due to non-obeyance of these rules.  
 
*(Addition) If the Host wishes to know beforehand when the Researcher publishes or enters results in a competition, the following clause shall be added.*

*"(8) When publishing or entering results in a competition, the Researcher shall notify the Host about this beforehand."*


####Article 14 (Warranty)   

> 14.1 In executing the Work, the Researcher shall warrant to the Host that the Researcher has legitimate authority to conclude this Agreement, and that the Work will not infringe on copyrights, patent rights, trademark rights, design rights, other intellectual property rights, or any other rights owned by a third party, or that mentally abuse, or violate the privacy of a third party. In the event of any dispute with a third party, Researcher shall cover all expenses (including legal fees and other costs) for resolving the problem.
> 
> 14.2 Whenever a product of the Work involves the Researcher's own patent rights etc. owned before commencement of the Work, the Researcher agrees not to enforce such rights.  


Provisions in this article are to guarantee that the Researcher can perform his/her work properly. Next to smooth contracting, these clauses specify that other people's rights shall not be violated.    
When acting in a way that infringes on someone else's rights, the Researcher may be asked to stop, and eventually compensate for damage. The Researcher warrants not to infringe on such intellectual property rights of others. In the event of any dispute with a third party, the Researcher shall cover all expenses for resolving the problem. 
Whenever the work and results of the project involve the Researcher's intellectual property rights, the Researcher shall not enforce these rights, such as by claiming suspension or compensation from the Host as well as from third parties utilizing the results.


####Article 15 (Use of Software etc. of a Third Party)

> Whenever the Work requires the use of software etc., the rights of which are owned by a third party, the Host and the Researcher shall discuss the matter, and decide on the usage of the software, such as by licensing or other necessary agreement with the third party.


If the execution of the work requires the use of additional software, such as commercially available video editing software for example, the Researcher and the Host shall discuss the purchase of that software.  


####Article 16 (Maintenance) 


> 16.1 The Researcher shall cooperate without compensation and to the extent possible on maintenance, administration, improvement and development (through user groups, etc.) of the Developed Software and the Developed Hardware for two (2) years after the Period of Stay.
> 
> 16.2 In the event of an OS update or other modification concerning the Developed Software's operating environment within one (1) year after the end of the Period of Stay, the Researcher shall make the upgrades necessary for the Developed Software to run in the respective new environment, and make the updated software accessible to the public without compensation. 
> 
> 16.3 In the event of an update to the integrated development environment, library or other parts of the development environment of the Developed Software within one year after the end of the Period of Stay, the Researcher shall make the upgrades necessary for the software to be developed in the respective new environment, and make the updated software accessible to the public without compensation. 
> 
> 16.4 In the event of a termination of manufacture of parts used for the Developed Hardware within one year after the end of the Period of Stay, the Researcher shall re-design and rebuild equally functioning hardware using the respective substitute part(s) without compensation, and make the updated hardware accessible to the public after verifying its operation. However, the Host shall cover the costs of substitute part(s), and the Researcher shall purchase the substitute part(s) only with the Host's consent.



This article specifies details related to support and maintenance after the period of the Researcher's stay/work.  

1 Next to general maintenance and administration, the Researcher's scope of cooperation also includes improvement and development. Maintenance and administration include debugging and version management, while cooperation regarding improvement and development could include the activation and support of user groups. Next to document creation and publication, this is extremely important for making the project and its results openly available, and spreading and developing them further. For example, when publishing results on source code sharing websites like GitHub, along with appropriate documents and support, this possibly leads to exchange among users, such as forking (producing alternative versions by duplicating and modifying codes) or using these results for various purposes. In order to facilitate such situations, the Researcher's response to user inquiries, discussions on the improvement of products, as well as information gathered through such activities, may be reflected in version upgrades. This regulation shall be valid for two years after the period of the Researcher's stay.   

2,3 It may happen that software cannot be developed or doesn't run due to updates of operating systems or development environments. In such cases, the Researcher shall make updated software available that runs on new operating systems or development environments. This provision applies for OS and development environment upgrades made within one year after the period of the Researcher's stay. 

4 In the event of a termination of manufacture of parts used for the developed hardware, which renders the production of hardware impossible, the Researcher shall update the hardware using the respective substitute part(s). In other words, the Researcher shall re-design and rebuild equally functioning hardware, and make the updated hardware accessible to the public after verifying its operation. This provision applies for parts the manufacture of which has been discontinued within one year after the period of the Researcher's stay. Regarding the purchase of substitute parts, the Host shall give prior consent, and cover the costs of these parts. 
 
Parts could include such small, inexpensive articles as Arduino for example. In case the re-design and rebuilding of hardware involves large costs comparable with the production of automobiles or rockets for example, arrangements will have to be made. 
 





##DivisionⅥ GENERAL TERMS 

####Article 17 (Prohibition of Re-commission)   

> The Researcher shall not re-entrust all or part of the Work to a third party. However, the Host and the Researcher may assign the Work to a third party if the Host permits such re-commission by a document to be issued after mutual agreement.

In principle, the Researcher shall not re-commission work related to the project to others. However, the Host may permit such re-commission by a document to be issued after mutual agreement with the Researcher. For example, the work could require additional imagery, the production of which may be commissioned to a third party.

> 
> [commission] = [full commission] x [number of actual days of operation] ÷ [number of days of stay]
 
If any point specified in this agreement cannot be fulfilled due to causes beyond the control of the Host and the Researcher, this shall not be regarded as a breach of contract. Examples would be natural disasters, wars, revolutions, riots or epidemics. The article further specifies a method for calculating the payment of commission in case the work cannot be carried out for such reasons.
 


####Article 20 (Discontinuation of Work) 

> If the Host decides to discontinue the Work, and no breach of contract by the Researcher is involved, the Host shall pay the Researcher 50% of the commission defined in Article 12 as the only remuneration.

In the event of a breach of contract or illegal action by either the Host or the Researcher, the respective other party may nullify this contract if obligations are not executed within one week after demanding fulfillment. This also applies in the case of bankruptcy for example.  
Liquidation here refers to the dissolution of foundations or other corporate institutions. In the event of a dissolution of a non-juridical organization, this situation may only be referred to as "dissolution".
If the Researcher acts against this agreement by canceling one-sidedly, this will be subject to nullification. Furthermore, it may involve the payment of damage compensation (see Article 22).   


####Article 22 (Damage Compensation)   

> 22.1 When the Researcher breaks all or part of this contract, the Researcher shall compensate for all resulting damage (including legal fees).
> 
> 22.2 When execution of the Work becomes impossible due to the Host's negligence, the Host shall compensate the Researcher by paying the full Commission as defined in Article 12, but deducting all expenses the termination of the Work renders unnecessary to incur.

In addition, the article regulates compensation in the event that execution of the work becomes impossible due to the Host's negligence – for example if a budget cannot be secured due to a procedural error. In such case, the Researcher does not have to pay for business operations that would normally have to be paid. If such error occurs at the preparation stage prior to the Researcher's stay, for example, this will include costs involved in the creation of documents related to insurance and visa applications. The Host shall compensate the Researcher by deducting such expenses (that the Researcher was originally supposed to spend) from the commission.    


####Article 23 (Responsibility) 

> In the event any damage to a third party arises out of the Work, the Host shall take no responsibility, and the Researcher will be liable for the damage if caused by the Researcher's own intention or negligence.
